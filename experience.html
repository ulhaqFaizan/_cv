				<li>No Frills, Milton, ON</li>
                <p>
                    As a Clerk at No Frills, I swiftly adapted to Canadian work culture post-relocation, honing essential problem-solving, time management, and teamwork skills in a fast-paced environment. This role allowed me to refine my attention to detail and improve my ability to work under pressure while managing inventory, assisting customers, and handling financial transactions. These experiences translated directly into my career as a developer, where precision, efficiency, and collaboration are key to success. My ability to streamline processes and deliver results under tight deadlines has become invaluable in my technical roles, especially in ensuring smooth project execution and customer satisfaction.

				<li>Jul 2021 - Aug 2023</li>
				<li><span>Web Developer</span></li>
				<li>Gameotivity, Islamabad, PK</li>
                <p>
                    As a Web Developer at Gameotivity, I had the opportunity to create and manage two distinct front-end websites for the company during its early growth phase. The first website, <a href="https://ulhaqfaizan.github.io/gameotivity1/" target="_blank">Gameotivity</a>, was developed when the startup needed a foundational online presence. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I collaborated closely with the UI team to design a basic yet informative site that clearly communicated what Gameotivity was all about. This site played a key role in establishing the company’s initial branding and awareness. Through this project, I strengthened my skills in front-end development and learned the importance of aligning technical implementation with brand identity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the company expanded, the need for a more interactive and robust website arose. For the second iteration, <a href="https://ulhaqfaizan.github.io/gameotivity2/" target="_blank">Gameotivity</a>, I transitioned to using ReactJS to build a more dynamic, feature-rich platform that provided a seamless user experience. In this phase, I worked closely with both the UI and backend teams, ensuring smooth integration of the blockchain functionalities central to Gameotivity's services. This collaboration honed my ability to work across teams, manage version control, and troubleshoot complex interactions between the front-end and back-end systems. I also learned the critical importance of scalability and performance optimization in delivering a responsive, user-friendly platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two projects not only enhanced my technical expertise but also deepened my understanding of agile development, team collaboration, and adapting to evolving project requirements. Through my time at Gameotivity, I grew as a developer, particularly in managing the lifecycle of web applications from initial conception to deployment and maintenance.

				<li><span>Co-founder</span></li>
				<li>Tripleone, Islamabad, PK</li>
                <p>
                    As a Co-founder at TripleOne, a clothing brand, I played a pivotal role in establishing and growing the business. I was responsible for various facets of the company, including product development, marketing strategies, and day-to-day operations. My role involved leading the design and launch of our online store, managing inventory, and implementing effective sales strategies to enhance our market presence. I also collaborated with the team to ensure a seamless shopping experience for our customers, from user-friendly website design to efficient order fulfillment. This experience not only sharpened my skills in e-commerce and retail but also deepened my understanding of brand management and digital marketing.                </p>
